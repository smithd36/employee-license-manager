# MedBase License Manager Web App
MedBase is a license management web application I developed that is actively being used in the medical industry. The main purpose is to track licensure for a large database of employees and notify administration upon nearing expirations. The website uses NextAuth to authenticate a user through Google and is directed to the database management system.
# Usage
This program is not meant to be cloned or modified, but can be ran on one's own database and authentication server through
- git clone
- npm run dev

# Technologies
The website uses Nextjs, NextAuth and Prisma as the Database ORM. The database is hosted on a MySQL Azure flexible server.
